Description
===========
This is a very simple (and very crappy) implementation of
Vectors/Matrices in Typescript. Publishing because it is a boilerplate
in making an automated build/testing process with webpack and mocha that
I will probably use again.

Installation
------------
1. run `npm install`
2. run `typings install`
3. run `npm start` to have webpack begin watching/building.
4. run `npm test` to have mocha watch the distribution and test it.
